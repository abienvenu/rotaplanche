RotaPlanche - A Unity MicroGame

RotaPlanche is a tiny skill game built with Unity. It aims to entertain kids, elderly people, and other casual gamers.

The purpose is to keep a rolling ball onto a rotating and shrinking planck as long as possible. The player fights against gravity, wind gusts, and time.

The player can press the "1", "2" or "3" key to change difficulty at any time. This will change the following parameters :
* The shrinking rate of the planck
* The rotating speed of the planck
* The strength of the wind gusts
* The speed of the wind changes

I also made this project to learn Unity, and now I share the code to let others learn and improve the game.

Feel free to send me a message if you make a better version of the game, or if you know about other OpenSource tiny games for casual gamers.
