RotaPlanche - A Unity MicroGame

RotaPlanche is a tiny skill game built with Unity. It aims to entertain kids, elderly people, and other casual gamers.

The purpose is to keep a rolling ball onto a rotating and shrinking planck as long as possible. The player fights against gravity, wind gusts, and time.

The player can press the "1", "2" or "3" key to change difficulty at any time. This will change the following parameters :
* The shrinking rate of the planck
* The rotating speed of the planck
* The strength of the wind gusts
* The speed of the wind changes

Binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac are available at https://abienvenu.itch.io/rotaplanche

I also made this project to learn Unity, and I share the code to let others learn and improve the game. The source code is available at https://github.com/abienvenu/rotaplanche - pull requests are welcome :-)

Have fun!
